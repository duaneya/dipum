function H = cnotch(type, notch, M, N, C, D0, n)
%CNOTCH Generates circularly symmetric notch filters.
%	H = CNOTCH(TYPE, NOTCH, M, N, C, D0, n) generates a notch filter
%	of size M-by-N. C is a K-by-2 matrix with K pairs of frequency
%	domain coordinates (u, v) that define the centers of the filter
%	notches (when specifying filter locations, remember that
%	coordinates in MATLAB run from 1 to M and 1 to N). Coordinates
%	(u, v) are specified for one notch only. The corresponding
%	symmetric notches are generated automatically. D0 is the radius
%	(cut-off frequency) of the notches. It can be specified as a
%	scalar, in which case it is used in all K notch pairs, or it can
%	be a vector of length K, containing an individual cutoff value
%	for each notch pair. n is the order of the Butterworth filter if
%	one is specified.
%
%       Valid values of TYPE are:
%
%           'ideal'     Ideal notchpass filter. n is not used.
%
%           'btw'       Butterworth notchpass filter of order n. The
%                       default value of n is 1.
%
%           'gaussian'  Gaussian notchpass filter. n is not used.
%
%       Valid values of NOTCH are:
%
%           'reject'    Notchreject filter.
%
%           'pass'      Notchpass filter.
%
%       One of these two values must be specified for NOTCH.
%
%  H is of floating point class single. It is returned uncentered
%  for consistency with filtering function dftfilt. To view H as an
%  image or mesh plot, it should be centered using Hc = fftshift(H).
