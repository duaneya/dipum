function [C, theta] = x2majoraxis(A, B)
%X2MAJORAXIS Aligns coordinate x with the major axis of a region.
%   [C, THETA] = X2MAJORAXIS(A, B) aligns the x-coordinate
%   axis with the major axis of a region or boundary. The y-axis is
%   perpendicular to the x-axis.  The rows of 2-by-2 matrix A are
%   the coordinates of the two end points of the major axis, in the
%   form A = [x1 y1; x2 y2]. Input B is either a binary image (i.e.,
%   an array of class logical) containing a single region, or it is
%   an np-by-2 set of points representing a (connected) boundary. In
%   the latter case, the first column of B must represent
%   x-coordinates and the second column must represent the
%   corresponding y-coordinates. Output C contains the same data as
%   the input, but aligned with the major axis. If the input is an
%   image, so is the output; similarly the output is a sequence of
%   coordinates if the input is such a sequence. Parameter THETA is
%   the initial angle between the major axis and the x-axis. The
%   origin of the xy-axis system is at the bottom left; the x-axis
%   is the horizontal axis and the y-axis is the vertical. 
%
%   Keep in mind that rotations can introduce round-off errors when
%   the data are converted to integer (pixel) coordinates, which
%   typically is a requirement.  Thus, postprocessing (e.g., with
%   bwmorph) of the output may be required to reconnect a boundary.
