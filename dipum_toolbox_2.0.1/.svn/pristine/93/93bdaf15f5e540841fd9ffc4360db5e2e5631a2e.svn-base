function g = movingthresh(f, n, K)
%MOVINGTHRESH Image segmentation using a moving average threshold.
%   G = MOVINGTHRESH(F, n, K) segments image F by thresholding its
%   intensities based on the moving average of the intensities along
%   individual rows of the image. The average at pixel k is formed
%   by averaging the intensities of that pixel and its n - 1
%   preceding neighbors. To reduce shading bias, the scanning is
%   done in a zig-zag manner, treating the pixels as if they were a
%   1-D, continuous stream. If the value of the image at a point
%   exceeds K percent of the value of the running average at that
%   point, a 1 is output in that location in G. Otherwise a 0 is
%   output. At the end of the procedure, G is thus the thresholded
%   (segmented) image. K must be a scalar in the range [0, 1].
