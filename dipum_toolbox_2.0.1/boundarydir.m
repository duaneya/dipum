function [dir, x0 y0] = boundarydir(x, y, orderout) 
%BOUNDARYDIR Determine the direction of a sequence of planar points.
%   [DIR] = BOUNDARYDIR(X, Y) determines the direction of travel of
%   a closed, nonintersecting sequence of planar points with
%   coordinates contained in column vectors X and Y. Values of DIR
%   are 'cw' (clockwise) and 'ccw' (counterclockwise). The direction
%   of travel is with respect to the image coordinate system defined
%   in Chapter 2 of the book.
%
%   [DIR, X0, Y0] = BOUNDARYDIR(X, Y, ORDEROUT) determines the
%   direction DIR of the input sequence, and also outputs the
%   sequence with its direction of travel as specified in ORDEROUT.
%   Valid values of this parameter as 'cw' and 'ccw'. The
%   coordinates of the output sequence are column vectors X0 and Y0.
%
%   The input sequence is assumed to be nonintersecting, and it
%   cannot have duplicate points, with the exception of the first
%   and last points possibly being the same, a condition often
%   resulting from boundary-following functions, such as
%   bwboundaries.
